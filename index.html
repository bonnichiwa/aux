    <h2 class="heading">Introduction</h2>
      <h3 class="heading">Greetings!</h3>
      <p class="blurb">I'm Bonnie and first off, thank you for taking the time to read through my application! Let's start this off with a little bit about me - quirky, happy, high on life, creative (though, highly subjective), dog-lover, nerd, aspiring UI/UX designer... this list goes on. </p>
      <p>Traditionally I've been trained as an Interior Designer, but recently life took a crazy (but good) turn and now I have been working as a (Frontend) Web Developer for about 9 months. I love it - I'm excited to go to work, but there's just something lacking and I think this goes back to my creative side. I love to code and everyday I'm learning something new but sometimes I definitely wish I was more involved with the design aspects of things.</p>
      <p>Then there I was again, in the position of asking myself 'what should I do now?'. It's been a hell of a ride since I've decided to get into development, but it definitely gets more and more excited with each passing day. There was that one fated day I discovered Fresh Tilled Soil's Apprenticeship in User Experience and that was the day I was able to tell myself 'I know what I should do now'!</p>

    <h2 class="heading">Case Study Objective/Task</h2>
      <p>One day I was contacted by a guy who was in the early stages of creating his startup. He was interested in my background and we decided to have a chat about the app he was developing which was trying to revolutionize the way food delivery is happening now.</p>
      <p>From there he wanted to see what my thoughts were on his current design of the app and invited me to do a redesign. I thought that this would be a good opportunity to try my hand at UI/UX design!</p>

        <h5 class="sub_heading">- A bad UI/UX Designer</h5>
        <p>Two of the most integral and yet often overlooked aspects of any app are the User Interface and the subsequent User Experience. Too often user’s are left confused and frustrated by convulated designs, poorly thought out features and unnatural elements, all constrained by unimaginitive and repetitive design trends.</p> 

        <p>Here at Ordr, design, creativity and the user experience are all part of our core ethos. From our versatile logo to our complex and yet beautifually simple UI, we have always endeavoured to creating an intuitive and captivating  experience and one that will set the standard for years to come. Keeping this in mind, while using our website, current app design, your own research into past, current and upcoming desgin trends and your personal design ethos, please put together a “look book” for how you believe our articles should look like. </p>

    <h2 class="heading">Case Study Submission</h2>
    <p>My approach to this was to utilize the most user-friendly navigation system, simple yet highly appealing designs. I started by first researching about the company's goals and philosophy. From there I determined that there were 3 different elements to take into consideration:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Newsfeed product</li>
        <li>Friend's posts on trending items</li>
        <li>Curated posts section based on your account</li>
      </ul>

    <p>These would be 3 main landing screens, and then it would go deeper one level into the 'post' that would be featured in each of these screens. I wanted to have the transitions seamless and require the least amount of effort, so simple screen slides to the right and left, screen pulled down, simple tap to read an overlay of the story or to view the gallery. </p>
    <p>The categories would be simply colour coded so users have an easy reference, and bookmarking a story would be as simple as a tap. The stories would be ordered chronologically, and I had different screen layouts for these stories to illustrate how they could be displayed differently. This would be decided upon best user experience and what would be better for viewing - large banner like images or small cards which would provide the information just as efficiently.</p>

    <h2 class="heading">Interactive Testing App</h2>
    <p>For the purpose of this assignment, I decided to quickly prototype how the app would work. As I had already created all the screens, I picked up Invision in no time and decided to create a small walkthrough for my submission. Enjoy! </p>
